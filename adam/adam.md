-- Who We Are -check

Deana and I have enjoyed 18 years of grace-filled marriage. Libby is our soon-to-be 15-year-old daughter and is a theater-loving rising freshman at Opelika High. Caleb is our wrestling enthusiast son, who will be a seventh-grade percussionist in the OMS band. Deana has spent the past two years loving on toddlers at FBCO's Bright Beginnings, but she's now in the process of getting back into public education after a 15-year hiatus. We are all members of First Pres Opelika.

-- How We Got Here -check

"A person’s steps are established by the LORD, and he takes pleasure in his way. Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed, because the LORD supports him with his hand. I have been young and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned or his children begging for bread. He is always generous, always lending, and his children are a blessing." Psalm 37:23-26

-- What God is Doing -check

"LORD, there is no one like you. You are great; your name is great in power. Who should not fear you, King of the nations? It is what you deserve. For among all the wise people of the nations and among all their kingdoms, there is no one like you." Jeremiah 10:6-7

-- Why Are We Seeking Ministry Partners?

In short, this is how God designed the body of Christ to function.

A funny thing happened as it became clear that God was calling our family to Women's Hope: we began to see that this ministry position would humble us, increase our dependence on God, and help us more fully understand how he chooses to provide.

Ephesians 6:19-20
Colossians 4:2-4

Philippians 4:17

-- Prayer -check

- For the Spirit to prepare the hearts and minds of the women and men who come through our doors; that they would decide to choose life if abortion vulnerable
- That Jesus would be proclaimed clearly and tangibly, in word and deed, and that truth would be spoken in love by every representative of Women’s Hope
- That salvation would come to those who do not yet acknowledge Jesus as Lord and Savior
- That God would continue graciously providing for the various needs of our family
