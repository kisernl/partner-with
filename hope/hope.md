Verbiage for giving page:

            Giving to Women’s Hope Medical Clinic makes a bigger difference than
            you may think. Together, we can support women and men facing
            unexpected pregnancies. One of the most powerful ways to show
            Christ’s love is by actively helping those in challenging
            situations. When a woman learns she is unexpectedly pregnant, she
            can feel many emotions, including fear, shame, and uncertainty.
            Perhaps she’s being pressured to have an abortion or doesn’t know
            how to move forward. It’s our responsibility to remind her that hope
            exists. Women’s Hope Medical Clinic is a beacon of support and
            encouragement during those hard times. For I Know The Plans I Have
            For You, Declares The Lord, Plans To Prosper You And Not To Harm
            You, Plans To Give You Hope And A Future. – Jeremiah 29:11 Your
            Financial Gifts Matter Your financial gifts do more than you
            realize. With your generosity, we can provide the following services
            to our clients and patients: Medical-grade pregnancy tests to
            confirm a potential pregnancy Ultrasounds to confirm key pregnancy
            details and protect the woman’s health Options consultations to give
            insight into adoption, parenting, and abortion STI testing (and
            treatment as necessary), which is offered to women with positive
            pregnancy test results Post-abortion support to help men and women
            recover from the pain of abortion Ongoing support services
            (including support for men) so those we serve know they are loved
            and valued All our services are free and confidential. Those we help
            will never have to worry about a bill. Sometimes, all a woman facing
            an unexpected pregnancy needs is hope. We’ve been serving our
            brothers and sisters in Christ for 40 years. Your support ensures
            that we can provide non-judgmental support for years to come. Note:
            If you would like to discuss other methods of giving (material
